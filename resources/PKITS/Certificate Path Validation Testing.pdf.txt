1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 	Background 
The Department of Defense (DoD) is deploying Class 3 and Class 4 Public Key 
Infrastructure (PKI).  The DoD and the DoD partners will rely on the commercial relying 
party PKI software and Applications Programming Interface (API) to perform the 
certification path validation.  In order to ensure secure interoperation of the PKI enabled 
applications, the path validation must be done in accordance with the X.509 standard.  
This document provides the test assertions and the test cases for testing the path 
validation software. 
1.2 	Scope and Objective 
The objective of this document is to test the path validation logic. 
The scope excludes testing whether certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) 
have been generated in accordance with any particular standard or profile such as X.509, 
PKIX, Federal Profile, or DoD Class 3 or Class 4 profile. 
The scope also excludes testing of the client software to appropriately parse certificates 
and CRLs.  The ability of the client software to appropriately parse certificates and CRLs 
will be tested to the extent that the certificates and CRLs need to be parsed during the 
path processing. 
In summary, the assertions and test cases are NOT meant to exercise the client 
software’s ability to handle correctly and incorrectly generated and coded certificates and 
CRLs. 
1.3 	Assumptions 
The following assumptions are used in generating the assertions and the test cases: 
1.	The certificates and CRLs are signed with the same Certification Authority (CA) 
using the same private key.  Thus, the issuer Distinguished Name (DN) in the 
certificate and the issuer DN in the CRL must match.  Furthermore, there is no 
need to develop a certification path for validating signatures on the CRL.  In fact, 
the same public key used to validate the signature on a certificate MUST be used 
to validate the signature on the CRL. 
2.	The Issuing Distribution Point (IDP) and delta CRL indicator extensions are out of 
the scope of this document.  A test including each extension has been included, 
which should fail whether or not the IDP or delta CRL indicator extensions are 
properly implemented. 
3.	The path processing logic used is from the X.509 2000 version.   
4.	The trust anchor certificate is not included in the certification path.  Thus, the only 
inputs from the trust anchor to the certification path validation logic are the trust 
anchor DN and the trust anchor public key. 
5.	There are no self-issued certificates in the certification path.  In other words, if a 
trust anchor rekeys, the subscribers have already replaced the old public key of 
the trust anchor with the new public key of the trust anchor; the intermediate CA 
rekey by obtaining new certificates from the CAs that certify them. 
6.	The following extensions and their values will not be tested during path validation 
in this version of the test document: authority key identifier, subject key identifier, 
private key usage period, issuer alternative name, subject alternative name, and 
name constraints.  Future versions of this document may contain tests that 
exercise these extensions. 
7.	Since the part of the 1997 defect resolution was to eliminate the processing 
differences between non-critical Certificate Policies extension and critical 
Certificate Policies extension, the tests assume that the certificate policies (and 
other extensions) will be processed the same way regardless of their criticality.  In 
other words, 2000 path validation logic will be used. 
8.	The basic constraints extension must be present in all intermediate certificates 
(i.e., in CA certificates).  This is a direct requirement of X.509 2000, reprinted here 
for emphasis.   
9.	The basic constraints extension may or may not be present in the end certificate.  
The path validation logic must not reject this certificate on the basis of the 
presence of this extension.  The software may reject this certificate if the certificate 
contains a critical basic constraints extension and the software does not process 
this extension.  But, in that case (see the previous assumption), the software is 
only capable of processing certification paths of length 1. 
10.	This version of the document only considers certificates signed with the RSA 
algorithm.  DSA signatures and keys, cross-algorithm certificates, and the 
complications added by parameters and parameter inheritance are out of the 
scope of this document. 
11.	This version of the document assumes that applications will treat a CRL as a valid 
CRL if it contains a nextUpdate later than the current date.  If the application 
decides CRL validity using another method (such as a delta from the thisUpdate 
date) the testers may need to configure the application and system so that the test 
data is acceptable to the local CRL policy.  If the application rejects good paths 
(particularly if the operator is informed that the rejection is due to the lack of 
acceptable revocation information) the tester should attempt the following: (a) 
configure the application to allow CRLs with a thisUpdate of Jan. 1, 1999 (b) 
configure the system time to be Jan. 1, 1999. 
1.4 	Document Conventions 
1.4.1 Assertions 
Sections 3 and 4 of this document correspond to requirements with X.509 related to 
Certificates and Certificate Revocation Lists, respectively.  Within these sections, the 
corresponding interoperability and security requirements from X.509 are divided into a set 
of assertions.  These assertions are statements that must be true in order for the 
software being tested to satisfy a given requirement of the X.509 path validation 
procedure.  As appropriate, assertions will also contain a reference to the appropriate 
section and quote from X.509.  Assertions are of the form: 
AS:<requirement_type>.<assertion_sequence_number> 
where “requirement_type” is an abbreviation for the type of requirement, and 
“assertion_sequence_number” is a sequential identifier for assertions within a requirement 
type.  Possible values for the requirement type are CP (certificate processing), IC 
(intermediate certificate processing), PP (policy processing), PL (path length), RL 
(revocation list). 
1.4.2 Testing Requirements 
Following each assertion is a set of testing requirements.  These requirements instruct the 
tester as to what he or she must do in order to test the software with respect to the given 
assertion.  These requirements are denoted by the form: 
TE:<requirement_type>.<assertion_sequence_number>.<sequence_number> where 
“requirement_type” and “assertion_sequence_number” are identical to the 
corresponding assertion requirement type and assertion sequence number, and 
“sequence_number” is a sequential identifier for tester requirements within the assertion 
requirement. 
1.4.3 Testing Levels 
Following each test requirement is a testing level number, for example: TE:CP.01.01, 
Level 1 indicates that test TE:CP.01.01 is a level 1 test.  There are three levels assigned 
to tests in this document, as follows: 
Level 0: No tests to run for this test requirement. 
Level 1: Must run described test(s) to successfully test interoperability and security Level 
2: Described test(s) provide further assurance that the application will be interoperable 
and secure.  Should be used to test applications if possible within scheduling and 
budgetary constraints. 
Level 3: Described test(s) used to pinpoint a problem in the application.  If an application 
fails certain level 1 or 2 tests, the level 3 tests should be provided to the application 
developer to assist with debugging and repair.  These tests should not be run by the 
Government. 
1.4.4 Test Data 
Section 5 of this document contains descriptions of the test data that is required by the 
testing requirements.  Each test requirement contains hyperlinks to the descriptions of the 
appropriate test data object(s). 
Some of the tests depend on the value of specific inputs to the path processing 
procedure, as described by X.509.  Due to space constraints, it is best to abbreviate the 
settings.  The following describes the abbreviations and their meanings.

2 DEFINITIONS 
This section contains some of the definitions used in this document. 
 
CA Certificate: A public key certificate whose subject is a CA. 
Certificate Chain: See Certification Path 
Certificate Extension: A field not within the original ASN.1 definition of Certificate which 
adds additional information to a certificate. 
Certificate Extension Criticality: An extension can be marked critical by the signer.  
When an implementation processing a certificate does not recognize an extension, if the 
criticality flag is FALSE, it may ignore that extension. If the criticality flag is TRUE, 
unrecognized extensions shall cause the structure to be considered invalid. 
Certificate Path: See Certification Path 
Certificate Serial Number: A field in a certificate containing an integer assigned by the 
CA to each certificate. The value of serialNumber must be unique for each certificate 
issued by a given CA. 
Certification Path: A chain of certificates starting from a certificate issued by the trust 
anchor of the relying party and ending with the certificate issued to the subject of interest 
to the relying party.  A Certification Path consists of 0 or more Intermediate Certificates 
and 1 End Certificate.  The first certificate in the Certification Path of length greater than 
1 is also called Intermediate Certificate.  The first certificate in the Certification Path of 
length 1 is called End Certificate since it the last certificate in the Certification Path. 
Certification Path Length: The number of certificates in a Certification Path.  Please 
note that in the basic constraints extension path length of n means n+1 certificates may 
follow.  
Current Time: The current time is an input into the certificate path validation process, and 
should be calculated by the best available means; preferably (but not necessarily) a 
trusted time source. 
Delta CRL: A CRL that provides updates to a referenced base CRL.  The combination of 
a Delta CRL and the referenced base CRL constitute a full and complete CRL. 
Distinguished Name: A unique name that identifies an entity.  A distinguished name is 
made up of one or more relative distinguished names (RDNs). 
Distinguished Name Equality: Distinguished names are equal if the ordered set of 
RDNs in one are equal to the ordered set of RDNs in the other.  X.501 section 9.4 
contains detailed information on “name matching”. 
End Certificate: The last certificate in a Certificate Chain.  The certificate could be a CA 
Certificate or an End Entity Certificate. 
End Entity Certificate: A public key certificate whose subject is not a CA 
Intermediate Certificate: Any certificate in a Certificate Chain except for the End 
Certificate.  Please note that an Intermediate Certificate must be issued to a CA and 
hence it must be a CA Certificate. 
issuer: A field in a certificate which identifies the entity that has signed and issued the 
certificate. 
notAfter: A field in a certificate that contains a date and time after which the certificate 
can no longer be used. 
notBefore: A field in a certificate that contains a date and time that the certificate can 
begin to be used. 
Signature: A signature is an cryptographic calculation of information to provide source 
authentication and data integrity.  The calculation is produced by first hashing the 
information, and then calculating a cryptographic function of the hash and the private key 
of the signer. 
Signature Verification: A signature verification is an cryptographic calculation of 
information to validate source authentication and data integrity.  The calculation is 
produced by first hashing the information, and then calculating a cryptographic function of 
the hash, signature and the public key of the signer. 
subject: A field in a certificate which identifies the entity associated with the public-key 
found in the subject public key field. 
Subordinate: An entity that has had its certificate signed by a superior. 
Superior: A certificate signer. ?
 
3 CERTIFICATE TESTING 
3.1 	Certificate Processing Tests 
The certificate processing tests, denoted with CP in the assertion and test case numbers, 
deal with the processing of every certificate within the certificate path.  This includes all 
intermediate certificates and the end certificate in the path.  The trust anchor is not 
considered, because the inputs from the trust anchor should solely be a public key and 
distinguished name. 
AS:CP.01 
The application must verify digital signatures on each certificate in the certification path 
using the superior public key. 
[X.509 10.5.1]Check that the signature verifies

Intermediate CRL CP.02.04, End Certificate CP.02.04 
Test 8: TE:CP.02.05, Level 2 
The following path should not validate successfully.  The end certificate has a notBefore 
set as a generalized time with a year of 2050: 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate CP.02.05, 
Intermediate CRL CP.02.05, End Certificate CP.02.05

Intermediate CRL CP.03.04, End Certificate CP.03.04 
AS:CP.04 
The application must check that names chain correctly.  Correct chaining is when the 
issuer of each certificate in the certificate path is equal to the subject of the superior 
certificate.  (In the case of the first intermediate certificate in the path, the issuer of the 
certificate must be equal to the trusted anchor name). 
[X.509 10.5.1] (Check) that the certificate subject and certificate issuer names chain 
correctly 
Test 13: TE:CP.04.01, Level 1 
The following path should not be successfully validated; the names that do not chain: 
(cn=A  vs.  cn=B): 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate CP.04.01, 
Intermediate CRL CP.04.01, End Certificate CP.04.01 
Test 14: TE:CP.04.02, Level 1 
The following path should not be successfully validated; the names differ by order (cn=A, 
ou=People, o=Org  vs.  cn=A, o=Org, ou=People): 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate CP.04.02, 
Intermediate CRL CP.04.02, End Certificate CP.04.02 
Test 15: TE:CP.04.03, Level 1 
The following path should be successfully validated; the names differ only by whitespace 
and capitalization which should be insignificant: 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate CP.04.03, 
Intermediate CRL CP.04.03, End Certificate CP.04.03 
Test 16: TE:CP.04.04, Level 3 
The following path should be successfully validated; the names differ only by whitespace 
(cn=My Name  vs. cn=My  Name): 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate CP.04.04, 
Intermediate CRL CP.04.04, End Certificate CP.04.04 
Test 17: TE:CP.04.05, Level 3 
The following path should be successfully validated; the names differ only by 
leading/trailing whitespace [quotes added for clarity] (cn=”  My Name”  vs. cn=”My  
Name  “): 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate CP.04.05, 
Intermediate CRL CP.04.05, End Certificate CP.04.05 
Test 18: TE:CP.04.06, Level 3 
The following path should be successfully validated; the names differ only by 
capitalization (cn=A  vs.  cn=a): 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate CP.04.06
Intermediate CRL CP.04.06, End Certificate CP.04.06 
TE:CP.04.07, Level 0 
(out of scope for current document) 
Test values other than printableString in the distinguished name fields, such as 
teletexString, bMPString, utf8String. 
AS:CP.05 
The application must be able to retrieve valid revocation data  for each certificate in the 
certificate path; if the application is unable to retrieve valid revocation data, it must reject 
the certificate path. 
[X.509 10.5.1] (Check) that the certificate has not been revoked. 
Test 19: TE:CP.05.01, Level 1 
The following path should not be successfully validated; it contains a path without 
revocation data: 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate CP.05.01, 
End Certificate CP.05.01 
TE:CP.05.02, Level 0 
(No test cases here) This assertion is further tested by the assertions in section 4 of this 
document.  The assertions in section 4 of this document determine the validity of 
revocation data. 
AS:CP.06 
The application must reject the certificate path if any certificate in the certificate path has 
been revoked.  (This assertion assumes valid revocation data can be used to check for 
revocation, and therefore depends upon assertion AS:CP.05). 
Test 20: TE:CP.06.01, Level 1 
The following path should not be successfully validated; the intermediate certificate has 
been revoked: 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate CP.06.01, 
Intermediate CRL CP.06.01, End Certificate CP.06.01 
Test 21: TE:CP.06.02, Level 1

revoked: 


Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate CP.06.02, 
Intermediate CRL CP.06.02, End Certificate CP.06.02 
3.2 	Intermediate Certificate Processing Tests 
The intermediate certificate processing tests, denoted with IC in the assertion and test 
case numbers, deal with the processing of every intermediate certificate within the 
certificate path.   
AS:IC.01 
The application must ensure that the basic constraints extension is present in every 
intermediate certificate in the certification path. 
[X.509 10.5.1] For an intermediate certificate, if the basic constraints extension field is 
present in the certificate, check that the cA component is present and set to true.   
[X.509 8.4.2.1, note 1] If (the basic constraints) extension is not present, or is flagged 
non-critical and is not recognized by a certificate-using system, then the certificate is to 
be considered an end-entity certificate and cannot be used to verify certificate 
signatures. 
Test 22: TE:IC.01.01, Level 1 
The following path should not be successfully validated; the intermediate certificate does 
not have a basicConstraints extension: 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate IC.01.01, 
Intermediate CRL IC.01.01, End Certificate IC.01.01 
AS:IC.02 
The application must ensure that every intermediate certificate in the certification path 
must have the basic constraints extension present, and the cA component set to true. 
Test 23: TE:IC.02.01, Level 2 
The following path should not be successfully validated; the intermediate certificate has 
the basicConstraints present and critical, with cA set to false: 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate IC.02.01, 
Intermediate CRL IC.02.01, End Certificate IC.02.01 
Test 24: TE:IC.02.02, Level 3 
The following path should be successfully validated; the intermediate certificate has the 
basicConstraints present and critical, with cA set to true: 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate IC.02.02, 
Intermediate CRL IC.02.02, End Certificate IC.02.02 
Test 25: TE:IC.02.03, Level 1 
The following path should not be successfully validated; the intermediate certificate has 
the basicConstraints present and not critical, with cA set to false: 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate IC.02.03, 
Intermediate CRL IC.02.03, End Certificate IC.02.03 
Test 26: TE:IC.02.04, Level 3 
The following path should be successfully validated; the intermediate certificate has the 
basicConstraints present and not critical, with cA set to true: 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate IC.02.04, 
Intermediate CRL IC.02.04, End Certificate IC.02.04 
AS:IC.03 
The application must reject a certificate path if any intermediate certificate in the 
certification path violates path length constraints presented in the pathLenConstraint field 
of the basic constraints extension in a superior certificate. 
[X.509 10.5.1]If the (basic constraints extension field is present in the certificate and the) 
pathLenConstraint component is present, check that the current certification path does 
not violate that constraint. 
TE:IC.03.01, Level 0 
This assertion is tested in section 3.4 of this document. 
AS:IC.04 
If the application encounters an intermediate certificate in the certificate path that has the 
key usage extension present with the keyCertSign bit set to true and the basic 
constraints extension present, the application must ensure that the certificate has the cA 
component of the basic constraints extension set to TRUE. 
[X.509 8.2.2.3] If KeyUsage is set to keyCertSign and the basic constraints extension is 
present in the same certificate, the value of the cA component of that extension shall be 
set to TRUE. 
[X.509 8.2.2.3] If [the keyUsage] extension is present, and the certificate-using system 
recognizes and processes the keyUsage extension type, then the certificate-using 
system shall ensure that the certificate shall be used only for a purpose for which the 
corresponding key usage bit is set to one. 
Test 27: TE:IC.04.01, Level 1 
The following path should be successfully validated; the intermediate certificate has the 
basicConstraints extension present, with cA set to true, and the keyUsage extension 
present, with the keyCertSign, and keyCRLSign flags set to true: 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate IC.04.01, 
Intermediate CRL IC.04.01, End Certificate IC.04.01 
AS:IC.05 
The application must ensure that every intermediate certificate in the certificate path that 
has the key usage extension present has the keyCertSign bit set to TRUE. 
Note: The tests for this assertion assume that the application can recognize and process 
the key usage extension.  If the application cannot recognize the key usage extension, 
all tests containing a critical key usage extension should result in failure, and all tests 
containing a non-critical key usage extension should result in success. 
[X.509 8.2.2.3] Bits in the KeyUsage type are as follows:… keyCertSign:  for verifying a 
CA’s signature on certificates; cRLSign:  for verifying an authority’s signature on CRLs… 
[X.509 8.2.2.3] If the extension is flagged critical, then the certificate shall be used only 
for a purpose for which the corresponding key usage bit is set to one. 
[X.509 8.2.2.3] If the extension if flagged non-critical, then it indicates the intended 
purpose or purposes of the key, and may be used in finding the correct key/certificate of 
an entity that has multiple keys/certificates. If this extension is present, and the 
certificate-using system recognizes and processes the keyUsage extension type, then 
the certificate-using system shall ensure that the certificate shall be used only for a 
purpose for which the corresponding key usage bit is set to one.  A bit set to zero 
indicates that the key is not intended for that purpose. If all bits are zero, it indicates the 
key is intended for some purpose other than those listed.

3.3 	Policy Processing Tests 
The policy processing tests, denoted with PP in the assertion and test case numbers, 
deal with the processing of certificate policies throughout the certificate path.  Many of 
these tests may be difficult to fully test for the following reasons: 
•	Applications may not be required to allow the user/tester flexibility in the 
configuration of the initial variables that are used as inputs to the path validation 
process.  These applications may have coded certain acceptable values within 
them, and the tester may not be able to modify those values to exercise certain 
test cases. 
•	Applications may not output the results of the path validation process to the user, 
other than a simple accept/fail indicator.  These applications will allow the tester 
to ensure that certificate paths which should not validate are not accepted, but 
will not allow the tester to view the outputs to ensure that they are being 
computed correctly by the application. 
•	Applications may not display policy qualifiers to the user before, during, or after 
certificate path validation.  These applications will not be able to be tested for 
assertion AS:PP.02. 
As is mentioned in the document conventions section, the results for many of these tests 
are related to the inputs to the path processing software.  The test results are then 
depicted as a matrix, containing the different possible application configurations, and the 
resultant outputs from the validation process.  Three inputs are possible, ipolset 
(initialpolicy-set), explicit (initial-explicit-policy), and inhibit (initial-inhibit-policy-
mapping).  If an input is not listed in the table, any value of that input will create the 
same result. 
In the test matrices below, paths in which the user-constrained-policy-set becomes 
<empty> and the explicit policy indicator is marked true, should be rejected by the 
application.  In cases in which the authority-constrained-policy-set is not <empty> the 
X.509 path validation algorithm has actually succeeded.  However, before accepting a 
path with an <empty> user-constrained-policy-set and a non-empty 
authorityconstrained-policy-set the application must ensure the user has knowledge 
that the path is not acceptable for policies in the user-constrained-policy-set, and the 
user must explicitly choose a policy from the authority-constrained-policy-set before 
accepting the path. 
AS:PP.01 
The software must be able to compute the authority constrained policy set correctly. 
Test 34: TE:PP.01.01, Level 1

4 REVOCATION STATUS RELATED TESTS 
There are different methods of providing revocation status data within an X.509 
compliant certificate issuing system.  Currently, only complete CRLs issued directly by 
the certificate-issuing authority are being tested.  Future versions of this document may 
include other revocation status methods. 
4.1 	Directly Issued Full CRL Related Tests 
The certificate revocation list (CRL) related tests, denoted with RL in the assertion and 
test case numbers, deal with the processing of CRLs during certificate path validation. 
AS:RL.01 
Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) may be used as the revocation status mechanism 
[X.509 7.3] (The X.509 specification) defines a Certificate Revocation List (CRL) 
mechanism but does not preclude the use of alternative mechanisms 
TE:RL.01.01, Level 0 
No testing for this.  If the application uses CRLs this assertion is satisfied. 
AS:RL.02 
The application must verify the signature on each certificate revocation list in the 
certification path using the same public key used to sign certificates. 
 [X.509 7.3] The certificates may be revoked by the same certificate-issuing authority 
directly 
Test 64: TE:RL.02.01, Level 1 
The following path should not be successfully validated; the path has a CRL containing 
an invalid signature: 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate RL.02.01, 
Intermediate CRL RL.02.01, End Certificate RL.02.01 
AS:RL.03 
When checking to see if a certificate is present on a certificate revocation list, the 
application must verify that the issuer name in the certificate matches the issuer name in 
the certificate revocation list. 
Test 65: TE:RL.03.01, Level 1 
The following path should not be successfully validated; the path contains a certificate 
revocation list from the wrong issuer, and the CRL signer’s certificate: 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate 1 
RL.03.01, Intermediate Certificate 2 RL.03.01, Intermediate CRL RL.03.01, End 
Certificate RL.03.01 
Test 66: TE:RL.03.02, Level 2 
The following path should not be successfully validated; the path contains a certificate 
revocation list with the wrong issuer name, and that list has the end certificate’s serial 
number on it.  If specified, the application should state the path failed because of a lack 
of revocation information, not because the end certificate was revoked. 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate RL.03.02, 
Intermediate CRL RL.03.02, End Certificate RL.03.02 
Test 67: TE:RL.03.03, Level 2 
The following path should be successfully validated; the path contains two certificate 
revocation lists, one with the wrong issuer name and one with the correct issuer name. 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate RL.03.03, 
Intermediate CRL 1 RL.03.03, Intermediate CRL 2 RL.03.03, End Certificate RL.03.03 
AS:RL.04 
The application should reject the path if any certificate in the certificate path has been 
revoked.  A certificate is revoked if its serial number appears in the revokedCertificates 
component of the CRL associated with the certificate signer. 
[X.509 7.3] revokedCertificates identifies certificates that have been revoked. The 
revoked certificates are identified by their serial numbers. 
TE:RL.04.01, Level 0 
This assertion is tested by the tests TE:CP.06.01 and TE:CP.06.02 
AS:RL.05 
The application should reject the path if any certificate in the certificate path has been 
revoked regardless of whether there are unrecognized critical crlEntryExtensions 
present in the CRL. 
[X.509 7.3] When an implementation processing a certificate revocation list does not 
recognize a critical extension in the crlEntryExtensions field, it shall assume that, at a 
minimum, the identified certificate has been revoked and is no longer valid and perform 
additional actions concerning that revoked certificate as dictated by local policy.  
Test 68: TE:RL.05.01, Level 1 
The following path should not be successfully validated; the path contains an 
intermediate certificate that has been revoked, along with a made up critical 
crlEntryExtension: 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate 1 
RL.05.01, Intermediate CRL 1 RL.05.01, Intermediate Certificate 2 RL.05.01,

69: TE:RL.05.02, Level 2 
The following path should not be successfully validated; the path contains an end 
certificate that has been revoked, along with a made up critical crlEntryExtension: 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate RL.05.02, 
Intermediate CRL RL.05.02, End Certificate RL.05.02 
AS:RL.06 
The application should reject the path if any certificate in the certification path has been 
revoked regardless of whether there are unrecognized critical crlExtensions present in 
the CRL. 
[X.509 7.3] When an implementation does not recognize a critical extension in the 
crlExtensions field, it shall assume that identified certificates have been revoked and are 
no longer valid 
Test 70: TE:RL.06.01, Level 1 
The following path should not be successfully validated; the path contains an 
intermediate certificate that has been revoked, along with a made up critical 
crlExtension: 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate 1 
RL.06.01, Intermediate CRL 1 RL.06.01, Intermediate Certificate 2 RL.06.01, 
Intermediate CRL 2 RL.06.01, End Certificate RL.06.01 
Test 71: TE:RL.06.02, Level 2 
The following path should not be successfully validated; the path contains an end 
certificate that has been revoked, along with a made up critical crlExtension: 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate RL.06.02, 
Intermediate CRL RL.06.02, End Certificate RL.06.02 
AS:RL.07 
The application should consider a certificate revocation list invalid if the nextUpdate time 
in the certificate is earlier than the current time. 
Note: local policy may permit a CRL be used even if the current time is later than the 
nextUpdate time in the CRL.  These tests contain CRLs that are very old, and most 
policies should restrict their use. 
[X.509 7.3] nextUpdate, if present, indicates the date/time by which the next revocation 
list in this series will be issued. The next revocation list could be issued before the 
indicated date, but it will not be issued any later than the indicated time. 
Test 72: TE:RL.07.01, Level 1 
The following path should not be successfully validated; the path contains a CRL with 
nextUpdate earlier than the current date: 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate RL.07.01, 
Intermediate CRL RL.07.01, End Certificate RL.07.01 
Test 73: TE:RL.07.02, Level 2 
The following path should not be successfully validated; the path contains a CRL with 
nextUpdate in UTC time with 50 as the year value (should treat as 1950): 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate RL.07.02, 
Intermediate CRL RL.07.02, End Certificate RL.07.02 
Test 74: TE:RL.07.03, Level 2 
The following path should be successfully validated; the path contains a CRL with 
nextUpdate as a Generalized time of 2050. 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate RL.07.03, 
Intermediate CRL RL.07.03, End Certificate RL.07.03 
AS:RL.08 
The application should ensure that the certificate revocation list does not contain the 
deltaCRLIndicator extension. 
[X.509 8.6.2.4] The delta CRL indicator field identifies a CRL as being a delta CRL 
(dCRL) that provides updates to a referenced base CRL. The referenced base CRL is a 
CRL that was explicitly issued as a CRL that is complete for a given scope. The CRL 
containing the delta CRL indicator extension contains updates to the certificate 
revocation status for that same scope. This scope does not necessarily include all 
revocation reasons or all certificates issued by a CA, especially in the case where the 
CRL is a CRL distribution point.  
Test 75: TE:RL.08.01, Level 1 
The following path should not be successfully validated; the path contains a CRL 
containing deltaCRLIndicator marked critical, with no Base CRL to serve as a reference: 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate RL.08.01, 
Intermediate CRL RL.08.01, End Certificate RL.08.01 
AS:RL.09 
The application should ensure that the certificate revocation list does not contain the 
issuingDistributionPoint extension. 
[X.509 8.6.2.2] This CRL extension field identifies the CRL distribution point for this 
particular CRL, and indicates if the CRL is limited to revocations for end-entity 
certificates only, for authority certificates only, or for a limited set of reasons only.   
Test 76: TE:RL.09.01, Level 1 
The following path should not be successfully validated; the path contains a CRL for 
end-entity certificates containing IDP marked critical, stating that only CA certificates are 
contained: 
Trust Anchor CP.01.01, Trust Anchor CRL CP.01.01, Intermediate Certificate RL.09.01, 
Intermediate CRL RL.09.01, End Certificate RL.09.01 
5 TEST DATA DESCRIPTIONS 
5.1 	Data Description Format 
Each test requirement will be tested by the use of a series of certificates, CRLs, and 
associated private keys as necessary, hereafter referred to as “data objects”.  This 
section of the document describes the construction of each data object required for 
testing. 
The data description format for each data object starts with a base data object and 
describes the differences between the base object and the target object. 
Example: 
End Certificate CP.99.99 include 
Base End Certificate 
issuer name: cn=CA1-CP.99.99 (other RDNs preserved) subject 
name: cn=User1-CP.99.99 (other RDNs preserved) validity 
notBefore: 440101120000Z (01/01/2044, 12:00:00 GMT) signed 
by Intermediate Certificate CP.99.99 
 
The table format used to describe the base data objects was developed by Robert 
Moskowitz of ICSA.net, and modified by Booz-Allen and Hamilton.  It has been further 
refined for this effort.  If a field or extension is not listed in the table, it is not used in any 
certificate. 
5.2 	Base Data Objects 
Where possible, the actual value that should be used in encoding has been inserted into 
the tables below.  Binary fields, such as keys, hashes, and signatures have been 
omitted.  Please refer to the comments field to determine how to construct any values 
that are not within the table. 
Additionally, some rows have been added to the table but do not exist in the base data 
object.  These rows are typically marked “absent” in the comments field.  The rows have 
been inserted as placeholders, because there are certificates within the test data that 
use those fields or extensions. 
5.2.1 Base Trust Anchor 
The base trust anchor information is as follows: 
Distinguished Name: cn=Trust Anchor, ou=Testing, ou=DoD, o=U.S. Government,
