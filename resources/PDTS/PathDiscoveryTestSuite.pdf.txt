1 Introduction 
1.1 Overview 
A certification path is an ordered list of certificates starting with a certificate issued by the relying 
party's trust root, and ending with the target certificate that needs to be validated. Certification  
path processing verifies the binding between the subject distinguished name and/or subject 
alternative name and the subject public key defined in the target certificate. The binding is 
limited  by constraints, which are specified in the certificates that comprise the path, and inputs 
that are specified by the relying party. 
Certification path discovery is the process of creating the certification path needed to validate a 
target certificate. In order to validate a target certificate, a certification path starting with one of  
the relying parties trust anchors and ending with the target certificate must be constructed and all 
relevant revocation status information must be located. This document includes descriptions for  
certificates and CRLs for several sample PKI architectures. In each PKI architecture includes  
several end entity certificates that can be designated as target certificates. A set of tests are 
defined  in which a target certificate and a trust anchor are defined. In some cases there is a valid  
certification path, which the relying party is expected to be able to build and validate and in some 
cases no valid certification path exists. 
1.2 Background 
In the fall of 2000, NIST worked in conjunction with CygnaCom Solutions and Getronics 
Government Solutions, LLC to develop a test suite for a subset of the features defined in the IETF 
PKIX Certificate and CRL Profile, RFC 2459. The resulting test suite, documented in  
Conformance Testing of Relying Party Client Certificate Path Processing Logic v. 1.07, has been 
widely used since its creation. Over the course of 2003 and 2004 the  	Public Key 
Interoperability  Test Suite (PKITS) Certification Path Validation was developed. PKITS was 
designed to cover  most of the features described in the successor to RFC 2549, RFC 3280, and 
was intended to be the successor to Conformance Testing of Relying Party Client Certificate Path 
Processing Logic. Both of these test suites were designed to enable the testing of the path 
validation capabilities of a path validation module (PVM), but not the path discovery capabilities 
of a PVM. 
This document was developed to complement PKITS and it is intended for use with PVMs whose 
path validation capabilities have already been verified using PKITS. The tests in this test suite are  
subdivided based on the complexity of the PKI architecture in which the certification path must be 
built and based on the method by which certificates and CRLs must be located. At the  
Rudimentary level, all target certificates are issued by CAs that are hierarchically subordinate to 
the trust anchor and all certificates and CRLs in the certification paths are limited to the features 
that are included in the requirements for Enterprise PVMs in the NIST Recommendation for X.509 
Path Validation. At the Basic level, the target certificates are issued by CAs that are not  
hierarchically subordinate to the trust anchor and certificates in the certification path include 
policy mappings, policy constraint extensions, and name constraints extensions. Some self-issued  
certificates assert the anyPolicy OID rather than asserting specific certificate policy OIDs. 
For each level of testing, there are three nearly identical PKI architectures. In the first PKI  
architecture none of the certificates include authorityInfoAccess or subjectInfoAccess extensions. 
Some certificates include cRLDistributionPoints extensions that specify a distribution point as a 


directoryName, but most certificates do not include a cRLDistributionPoints extension. In the  
other two PKI architectures, authorityInfoAccess, subjectInfoAccess, and cRLDistributionPoints 
extensions are included where appropriate. In one of the PKI architectures these extensions are  
populated with LDAP URIs and in the other PKI architecture these extensions are populated 
with HTTP URIs. 
1.3 Getting the Test Data 
Information about obtaining the data needed to run the tests in this test suite may be found at 
http://csrc.nist.gov/pki/testing/pathdiscovery.html.  From this site it will be possible to download 
a copy of this document as well as all of the trust anchor certificates, end entity certificates, and 
S/MIME messages specified in this document. The Web site will also specify the location of an  
LDAP server from which the certificates and CRLs for the first PKI architecture may be 
obtained.

2.3 Definitions 
This section contains some of the definitions used in this document. 
CA Certificate	
Certification Path	
Distinguished Name	
A public key certificate whose subject is a CA. 
A chain of certificates starting with a certificate issued by 
the trust anchor of the relying party and ending with the 
certificate issued to the subject of interest to the relying 
party. A Certification Path consists of zero or more  
Intermediate Certificates and one End Certificate.  The 
first certificate in a Certification Path of length greater 
than one is also called an Intermediate Certificate. The 
first  certificate in a Certification Path of length one is 
called an End Certificate since it is the last certificate in 
the Certification Path. 
An unambiguous name that identifies an entity. A  
distinguished name is made up of one or more relative 
distinguished names (RDNs). 
End Certificate	
The last certificate in a Certification Path. 
End Entity Certificate	
A public key certificate whose subject is not a CA. 
Intermediate Certificate	
Any certificate in a Certification Path except for the End 
Certificate.

4.2.4 Additional Basic Bridge Path Discovery Tests 
In each of the three basic level PKI architectures (Directory, LDAP URI, and HTTP URI), the 
trust anchor CA is cross-certified with a “bridge” CA which has in turn cross-certified several 


“organizational” CAs. The certificates and CRLs of the bridge CA and the organizational CAs are  
nearly identical in all three architectures with the only significant differences lying in the 
methods by which the certificates and CRLs needed for path validation may be located. In each 
case, the  trust anchor has issued two certificates to the bridge CA with each certificate 
containing different policy information. This section provides a brief description of each of the 
organizational PKIs  that are cross-certified with the bridge along including information about the 
end entity certificates issued within each organization. 
4.2.4.1 Organization 1 
Organization 1 (OU1) operates a single CA that issues certificates under four different policies 
only three of which are mapped to policies at the bridge CA. The bridge CA has issued a cross- 
certificate to OU1 that includes the mapping information for these three policies and that 
includes a name constraints extension limiting OU1 to OU1's name space. The following end 
entity  certificates have been issued by OU1: 
Basic Directory Path Discovery OU1 EE1: 
Basic LDAP URI Path Discovery OU1 EE1: 
Basic HTTP URI Path Discovery OU1 EE1: 
These certificates assert certificate policy 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.48.37, which maps 
to 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.48.7 at the trust anchor. 
Basic Directory Path Discovery OU1 EE2: 
Basic LDAP URI Path Discovery OU1 EE2: 
Basic HTTP URI Path Discovery OU1 EE2: 
These certificates assert certificate policy 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.48.38, which maps 
to 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.48.1 and 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.48.3 at the trust anchor. 
Basic Directory Path Discovery OU1 EE3: 
Basic LDAP URI Path Discovery OU1 EE3: 
Basic HTTP URI Path Discovery OU1 EE3: 
These certificates assert certificate policy 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.48.39, which maps 
to 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.48.10 at the trust anchor. 
Basic Directory Path Discovery OU1 EE4: 
Basic LDAP URI Path Discovery OU1 EE4: 
Basic HTTP URI Path Discovery OU1 EE4: 
These certificates assert certificate policy 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.48.40.  Since 
crosscertificate from bridge CA to the OU1 CA does not include any mapping to 
2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.48.40 and since both cross-certificates from the trust anchor to 
the bridge CA include a policyConstraints extension with requireExplicitPolicy set 
to 0, there certificates are not valid. 
Basic Directory Path Discovery OU1 EE5: 
Basic LDAP URI Path Discovery OU1 EE5: 
Basic HTTP URI Path Discovery OU1 EE5: 
The subject names in these certificates do not satisfy the name constraints extension 
in the cross-certificate from the bridge CA to the OU1 CA and so these certificates 
are not valid. 
4.2.4.2 Organization 2 
Organization 2 (Org2) operates a single CA that has maintains four key pairs as a result of having 
performed key rollover three times. After each key rollover two self-issued certificates were  
created, one containing the new public key signed by the previous private key and one containing 
the previous public key signed by the new private key. The CRLs are signed by the newest private  
key, but the bridge CA cross-certified with second newest key pair. All of the end entity  
certificates assert two certificate policies. One policy maps to 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.48.1 and  
2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.48.3 at the trust anchor while the other policy does not map to any other 
policies. In the Directory and LDAP URI architectures, LDAP referrals must be followed in order  
to obtain the information from Org2's directory entry. The end entity certificates differ by the key  
used to sign them and the CRL distribution point that they reference. Some of the certificates have  
been revoked. 
Basic Directory Path Discovery Org2 EE1: 
Basic LDAP URI Path Discovery Org2 EE1: 
Basic HTTP URI Path Discovery Org2 EE1: 
These certificates were signed by the private key corresponding to the public key 
that was certified by the bridge CA. 
Basic Directory Path Discovery Org2 EE2: 
Basic LDAP URI Path Discovery Org2 EE2: 
Basic HTTP URI Path Discovery Org2 EE2: 
These certificates were signed by the private key corresponding to the public key 
that was certified by the bridge CA and they have been revoked. 
Basic Directory Path Discovery Org2 EE3: 
Basic LDAP URI Path Discovery Org2 EE3: 
Basic HTTP URI Path Discovery Org2 EE3: 
These certificates were signed by the private key that was generated prior to the 
key pair that was certified by the bridge CA. 
Basic Directory Path Discovery Org2 EE4: 
Basic LDAP URI Path Discovery Org2 EE4: 
Basic HTTP URI Path Discovery Org2 EE4: 
These certificates were signed by the private key that was generated prior to the 
key pair that was certified by the bridge CA and they have been revoked. 
Basic Directory Path Discovery Org2 EE5: 
Basic LDAP URI Path Discovery Org2 EE5: 
Basic HTTP URI Path Discovery Org2 EE5: 
These certificates were signed by the oldest private key. The self-issued certificate  
with the oldest public key, signed by the second oldest private key, has been 
revoked and so these certificates cannot be validated. 
4.2.4.3 Organization 3 
Organization 3 (OU3) operates 3 CAs: a principal CA that is cross-certified with the bridge CA; a 
peer CA that is cross-certified with the principal CA; and a subordinate CA that has been issued a 
certificate by the principal CA. The cross-certificate from the bridge CA to the principal CA  
includes a name constraints extension that is not satisfied by the cross-certificate from the principal 
CA to the peer CA. This cross-certificate asserts two certificate policies, one which is mapped to  
policies used by OU3 and one which is not mapped. 
Basic Directory Path Discovery OU3 EE1: 
Basic LDAP URI Path Discovery OU3 EE1: 
Basic HTTP URI Path Discovery OU3 EE1: 
These certificates were issued by the subordinate CA and each assert the four 
certificate policies including one that maps to 2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.48.10 at the  
trust anchor. 
Basic Directory Path Discovery OU3 EE2: 
Basic LDAP URI Path Discovery OU3 EE2: 
Basic HTTP URI Path Discovery OU3 EE2: 
These certificates were issued by the subordinate CA and assert the certificate 
policy that was included in the cross-certificate from the bridge CA to the OU3 
principal CA (2.16.840.1.101.3.2.1.48.2). This policy is also asserted in the cross- 
certificate from the trust anchor to the bridge CA that does not include a policy 
mappings extension. Thus, validating these certificates requires the use of a  
different cross-certificate from the trust anchor to the bridge CA than is used to 
validate all of the other end entity certificates. 
5 Test Data Descriptions

5.2 Cross Certificate Pairs 
RFC 2587 states that “[t]he forward elements of the crossCertificatePair  attribute of a CA's 
directory entry shall be used to store all, except self-issued certificates issued to this CA. 
Optionally, the reverse elements of the crossCertificatePair  attribute, of a CA's directory entry 
may contain a subset of certificates issued by this CA to other CAs.” This section specifies the  
crossCertificatePairs  that are to be generated for each cross-certificate specified in the previous 
section. 
For each crossCertificatePair  in which the forward  [issuedToThisCA] element is populated, 
the crossCertificatePair  is placed in the directory entry identified by the subject DN of the 
certificate. For each  	crossCertificatePair  in which the reverse  [issuedByThisCA] element is 
populated, the crossCertificatePair  is stored in the directory entry identified by the issuer DN 
of the certificate.
